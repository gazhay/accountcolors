# Account Colors

Fork of the Account Colors add-on for Thunderbird

Continuation of the [account colours plugin](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/thunderbird/addon/account-colors/) for modern thunderbird(s).


# Thunderbird 128+

The addon no longer works. 
Quite a bit of changes to Thunderbird and to be honest unless you are working with addons for Thunderbird regularly, its impossible to keep up with all the breaking changes.

I don't have the time, but will keep the repo open in the hopes of a PR from someone with more time and knowledge.
